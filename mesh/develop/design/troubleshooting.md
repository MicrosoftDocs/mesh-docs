# Troubleshooting

Mesh is still in development, with new features and updates to existing features ongoing. You may find that some features or experiences are not polished or fully functional.

For details on features, bug fixes, and known issues related to the Mesh toolkit, see our [Release notes](../../Resources/mesh-toolkit-release-notes.md) and [Known issues](../../Resources/mesh-toolkit-known-issues.md) articles.

If you find new issues, you can provide feedback by using the Feedback button inside any Mesh experience. This ensures that your feedback and bug reporting will be triaged and incorporated quickly.

If you're not able to give feedback or report bugs using the Feedback button, use the Teams chats with your Microsoft partners or contact your Microsoft partners directly.

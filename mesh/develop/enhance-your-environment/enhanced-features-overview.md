# Enhanced features overview

After you've created a basic Environment, take it to the next level by incorporating one or more of the features or technologies listed below. 

* [Mesh physics](physics/mesh-physics-overview.md), used to create enabling and engaging dynamic content.

* [Mesh interactables](avatar-and-object-interactions/interactables.md), allowing participants to grab, hold, throw, select, anchor, tether and spawn

* [Mesh controllables](multi-room-sync.md), enabling event hosts to control and sync video and timeline playback across multiple rooms of a large event.

* [Mesh WebSlates](webcontent.md), enabling designers to add a panel that displays a given web page.

* [Mesh Spatial Audio](./spatial-audio-customization/audio-customization-overview.md), which lets you create individual spaces in an environment, with each having their own unique audio settings.

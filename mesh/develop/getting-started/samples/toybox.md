# Microsoft Mesh toolkit Sample: Toybox

![Toybox](../../../media/samples/005-toybox.png)

*Toybox* is a Mesh sample that empowers creators to build interactive Mesh experiences and games. The sample provides a number of activities that use mixtures of assets, shaders, visual scripting, animations, VFX, and SoundFX to drive social engagment across Mesh experiences:
  
* **Bean Bag Toss** 
* **Fire Pit & Roasting Marshmallows** 
* **Ice Breaker**
* **Sound Orbs** 
* **Radio & Boombox** 
* **Bonus: Astronaut**

The [Samples Overview](samples-overview.md) page contains instructions on how to download the Mesh toolkit which contains this sample.

## Warning about sample load time

The sample could take 15 minutes or slightly longer to load into Unity due to large asset sizes. If you need to, change your Sleep mode setting so that the computer doesn't go to sleep while the project is loading. If this happens, it could cause the project to not load properly.

## Contributions

We are not currently accepting code contributions to our samples.  If you have any feedback or if you run into any issues with the samples or the Mesh toolkit, do the following: in a Unity project that has the Mesh toolkit package installed, select **Mesh Toolkit** -> **Give feedback to Microsoft** and then use the feedback link in the Mesh toolkit to let us know.

# Choose your journey

To build experiences for Mesh, you must have intermediate to advanced Unity skills.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A Teams Premium license is required for using the Mesh application for custom immersive spaces in Mesh on PC and Quest. A license isn't required to develop with the Mesh toolkit, but you'll be blocked from building and publishing Environments to Mesh and organizing or joining events in Mesh if you and your users don't have Teams Premium licenses. For more information, see [Set up M365 for Microsoft Mesh](../../Setup/Content/setup-m365-mesh.md).

## Try our Mesh 101 tutorial

If you're new to Mesh and like the idea of learning through a step-by-step tutorial, we recommend that you try our [Mesh 101 tutorial](mesh-101-tutorial/mesh-101-01-overview-and-setup.md). It starts you off with a pre-built Unity project and then walks you through the process of creating an educational windfarm experience. You'll learn how to use Mesh scripting and physics to add interactivity, and then you'll upload the project as an *Environment* to a Collection in Mesh on the web.

## Start with a Mesh sample

You can start with a sample project to quickly get inspired about what you can build with Mesh. These projects are already set up with the Mesh toolkit.

## Update an existing project or create a new one

You can [create a new 3D URP (Core) project or update an existing Unity project](../build-your-basic-environment/create-a-new-project-or-update.md) to start building your Mesh environment.

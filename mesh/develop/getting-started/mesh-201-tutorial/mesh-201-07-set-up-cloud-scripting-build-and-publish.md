# Set up cloud scripting and build and publish

TBD: 
--get a subscription (if needed)
--To to Azure portal, get sub. ID, region, location
--go through B&P process with cs info added
--copy and paste private keys which allows you to access weatherapi.com

Point out the different prerequisites

## Setting up for this station

Similar to what you did for the previous station, you'll need to insert a *key* into some code that'll enable you to access the Azure OpenAI API for this station. As before, we'll do this step first so that you don't have to interrupt your workflow later on.

1. TBD - See Denis video.

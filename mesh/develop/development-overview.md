# Mesh Development Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective June 24th, 2025, the Microsoft Mesh toolkit has been retired, and Microsoft Mesh will evolve.
>
> As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver the best possible experience to our Microsoft Mesh customers, we are evolving how users interact with customization tools and scripting features. The Mesh Toolkit and Meshâ€™s customization capabilities will undergo significant changes in the near future to streamline operations and prepare for future enhancements. We plan to transition all customization to our in-app, no-code customization experience.
>
> As we transition to this new way to create Mesh experiences, we will change the current implementation and availability of creator tools. Effective June 24, 2025, publishing new environments to Mesh with the Mesh toolkit will not be supported. Existing environments published before June 24, 2025, may still continue to function as expected but cannot be edited with the Mesh toolkit. As no-code customization tools become available, organizations will be able to more easily create and maintain similar immersive experiences. We will publish guidance on best practices for rebuilding your experiences as the tools become available and will also ensure that we give creators sufficient time to recreate experiences using these new tools before the previous iterations become unavailable.

# Manage Mesh collections

Use Mesh on the web to create events, invite co-organizers or attendees, manage environments and templates, and create collections to hold custom environments. For any custom environments to be uploaded using the Mesh toolkit in Unity, you'll need a collection to hold your uploads, making them accessible to any event organizer in your organization.

To provide context, Mesh on the web has the following pages:

- **Home:** See upcoming events and access some useful articles.
- **Events:** [Create or manage events](../../events-guide/create-event-mesh-portal.md) that are joined view the Microsoft Mesh application.
- **Environments:** View and manage the environments that are available from Microsoft or view the environments and Templates that were uploaded to your collections.
- **Collections:** View, manage, and [create collections](#create-a-collection) to hold custom environments and templates.

## Prerequisites

Microsoft 365 Admins should use the M365 Apps Admin Center to ensure that Mesh is properly setup and access  to Mesh is allowed. If Mesh on the web is not accessible to you, you may need to ask your IT Admin or wait for the policy to be available for your organization.

Learn more about [how to set up Mesh experiences in M365](setup-m365-mesh.md).

## Overview of Collections

Collections are the home for your custom environments that are developed in Unity and uploaded using the Mesh toolkit uploader, as well as a place to review [Templates that you create](../../events-guide/create-template.md) to be reused in events.

## Create a Collection

See how to create a collection to house your uploaded environments and any templates you create.

1. Open Mesh on the web at [https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/](https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/) or [https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/](https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Mesh on the web is moving to cloud.microsoft [with all Microsoft 365 apps and services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-cloud-microsoft-a-unified-domain-for-microsoft-365/ba-p/3804961). To help ease this transition, we are providing two links for Mesh on the web. To use the new cloud.microsoft endpoint, ensure you have allowed the proper endpoints allowed, as detailed in the [Preparing your organization article](preparing-your-organization.md).
    >
    > If you have any issues with the new Mesh on the web experience, you can continue to use *portal.mesh.microsoft.com*.

1. In the Home page, select **Collections** in the left nav.

# IT admin-led trials for Microsoft Mesh

This article describes how to set up and run an IT Admin-led trial pilot program to deploy Microsoft Mesh in your organization.

## Prerequisites

There are [licensing requirements](../../Resources/mesh-troubleshooting.md#what-are-the-license-requirements-for-immersive-spaces-in-mesh) and [configuration steps](preparing-your-organization.md#preparing-your-organization-for-mesh) needed prior to beginning your Microsoft Mesh trial.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the trial is activated, the six-month trial starts. Please ensure your organization is configured to run Microsoft Mesh prior to activating the trial.

- [Preparing your organization for Microsoft Mesh](preparing-your-organization.md) by assigning the suggested functional roles that may be involved in the rollout of Microsoft Mesh, and consider the various required configuration tasks.
- To use Microsoft Mesh, all users (including developers, event organizers, and event attendees/users) are required to have a M365 Office subscription with access to SharePoint, OneDrive, and M365 Calendar. Ensure your organization has a M365 Business Basic/Standard/Premium, Office 365 E1/E3/E5, or Microsoft 365 E3/E5 subscription and users have licenses assigned.
- Review the [roles needed to start the Microsoft Mesh trial](#roles-needed-to-start-trial-and-assign-licenses) and assign licenses.

If you don't purchase licenses following the trial:

- Users will no longer be able to access Microsoft Mesh.
- Users will continue to have access to the Mesh toolkit in Unity but will be unable to access the Microsoft Mesh application to publish and experience your environments in Mesh.

    In this case, the page will say "The offer that you want is unavailable..."

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/admin-led-trial/Trial-redeemed-page.png" alt-text="Page on a browser showing that your Mesh trial is not valid.":::
1. **You have incorrect permissions.**

    In this case, the page will say "Switch to an account that has permission."
1. **You do not have access to Microsoft Entra. Your account must be associated with or managed through Microsoft Entra.**

    In this case, the page may say "Hmm... can't reach that page. The connection was reset."

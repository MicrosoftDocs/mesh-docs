## Microsoft Mesh

We're reimagining the way employees come together with [Microsoft Mesh](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/microsoft-mesh), powering several immersive experiences across the devices you use every day.

Microsoft Mesh enables your distributed workforce to connect in 3D immersive experiences using Microsoft Teams, a PC, or a Meta headset, helping you feel that virtual meetings and events are more like face-to-face connections.

### Why immersive?

Immersive experiences have unique attributes, including spatial interaction, co-presence, and immersion, that create a perception of being physically together in a 3D digital space. Digital engagement is evolving from audio to video and now to spatial interaction.

**Spatial awareness** through directionality and distance enables multiple small group discussions in the same place, adding familiar human elements to digital connections. Spending time with others in the same 3D environment also creates a powerful sense of togetherness, or co-presence, even when you're not actively speaking.

**Co-presence** can lead to spontaneous moments of conversation or even just the deepened connection of a shared experience. Mesh allows you to focus on what matters: people, conversations, and a unique shared space.

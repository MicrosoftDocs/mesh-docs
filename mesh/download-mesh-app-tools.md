# Experience Mesh

Get quick access to all the Mesh apps and tools in the sections below.

If Mesh is not set up for your organization, see how to [Set up Microsoft Mesh](Setup/Content/setup-m365-mesh.md).

[!INCLUDE [<download-apps>](<includes/download-apps.md>)]

## Mesh on the web

Use Mesh on the web to create events, invite co-organizers or attendees, manage environments and templates, and create collections to hold custom environments.

Create events, and manage collections, environments, and templates at [https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/](https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/) or [https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/](https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/).

> [!NOTE]
> Mesh on the web is moving to cloud.microsoft [with all Microsoft 365 apps and services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-cloud-microsoft-a-unified-domain-for-microsoft-365/ba-p/3804961). To help ease this transition, we are providing two links for Mesh on the web. To use the new cloud.microsoft endpoint, ensure you have allowed the proper endpoints allowed, as detailed in the [Preparing your organization article](Setup/Content/preparing-your-organization.md#endoints-and-firewall-ports-for-immersive-spaces-in-mesh-mesh-app).
>
> If you have any issues with the new Mesh on the web experience, you can continue to use *portal.mesh.microsoft.com*.

## Mesh Toolkit

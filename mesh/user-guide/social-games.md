# Social games and activities

Immersive experiences provide a unique opportunity to bond, collaborate, and play similar to how we would in real life without having to physically be together.

Try out an Immersive space (3D) in Microsoft Teams or create your own activities for the Mesh app by exploring the samples like the Toybox environment.

## Activities in Immersive spaces in Teams

Join the Lakehouse environment in the immersive space in Teams from a Teams meeting.

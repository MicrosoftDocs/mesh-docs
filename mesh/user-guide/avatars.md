# Personalize your avatar

In Mesh events, you're represented by avatars. By customizing your avatars the way you want to look, you can be yourself and let people know you in a conversation.

* **Choose how you’re represented** – There’re endless possibilities on how you want to customize an avatar that represents your physical attributes, wardrobe, accessories, and more. Choose how you express yourself with reactions and gestures. Save up to three avatars for different meeting types such as casual, professional, or day-to-day.
* **Use the same avatar across Mesh experiences** – The same avatar that you create are available to you when you join a Teams meeting, an immersive space from a Teams meeting or a Microsoft Mesh event.

For more information, see [Join a meeting as an avatar in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-a-meeting-as-an-avatar-in-microsoft-teams-5384e7b7-30c7-4bcb-8065-0c9e830cc8ad).

## Create your avatars

You can access avatar customization from the following entry points:

* Mesh app on PC
* Mesh app on Quest

You can create up to three different versions of your avatar to show off your personas in Mesh experiences. 

To create a new avatar, select **+** after clicking the **Profiles** button in the lower right corner of your Mesh App. You can also click on any of the existing avatars you have previously built to start [customizing](#customize-your-avatars).

To create a new avatar, you'll start by selecting a base avatar from the avatars template.

## Customize your avatars

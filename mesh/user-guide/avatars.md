# Personalize your avatar

In Mesh events, you're represented by avatars. By customizing your avatars the way you want to look, you can be yourself and let people know you in a conversation.

* **Choose how you’re represented** – There’re endless possibilities on how you want to customize an avatar that represents your physical attributes, wardrobe, accessories, and more. Choose how you express yourself with reactions and gestures. Save up to three avatars for different meeting types such as casual, professional, or day-to-day.
* **Use the same avatar across Mesh experiences** – The same avatar that you create are available to you when you join a Teams meeting, an immersive space from a Teams meeting or a Microsoft Mesh event.

## Create your avatars

You can access avatar customization from the following entry points:

* Avatars app in Teams
* Mesh app on PC
* Mesh app on Quest

You can create up to three different versions of your avatar to show off your personas in Mesh experiences. 

### In the Avatars app

To create a new avatar, open the avatars app in Teams.

> [!TIP]
> You may need to search for the app if you haven't pinned it to your sidebar.

# Mesh user controls

## Mesh Dashboard

The Mesh Dashboard displays all Mesh events available to you. The Mesh Dashboard is the main interface you can use to explore what Mesh has to offer.

The Dashboard is viewable using the Mesh app on PC or Quest.

>[!Note] 
>On the Dashboard, the changes from upcoming to live events are updated automatically.

## Move around in your event

### On PC

You can look around, walk, run, teleport around, or just sit at the
table with other avatars. To move around, press the **WASD** keys.

For details, you can also access the **Control tutorial** from the **Help** menu:

Use **V** to toggle between direct view and avatar view (1st and 3rd     person views)

### On Quest

For details on how to move around with your Quest devices, you can access the **Control tutorial** from the **Help** menu.

## Mesh controls overview

Now that you're in an event, explore the interface to see what controls are available. To the left, we have the **System Menu** with [**Dashboard**](#mesh-dashboard), [**Settings**](#adjust-settings), [**Feedback**](/mesh/resources/feedback), and **Quit Mesh**. The app bar in the middle holds the [**Participants**](#participants), [**Selfie**](#take-a-photo-or-selfie), [**Hand raise**](#raise-hand-to-speak-to-hosts-and-all-participants), and [**Reactions**](#react-with-emotes) buttons. The [**Profile**](#profile) button in the lower right corner holds the **Customize** button for customizing your avatars.

You can also click on [the Nametag and contact card](#nametag-and-contact-card) of other participants to find out more information about them.

### Adjust settings

The **Settings** menu helps you to set up the app according to your preferences. There are many options available here. It can be accessed directly from the bottom left menu button of the Mesh menu bar.

You can also select and setup your audio devices in the **Settings** dialog, **Display & sound -> Devices**.

### Participants

The **Participants** button will show the number of participants in an event.

### Take a photo or selfie

Use the **Camera** button on the app bar to take a selfie of yourself with friends or snap a picture from the view of your avatar!

>Avatars nametags are turned off by default when taking a photo or selfie. You can still turn on the nametag by clicking on **...** in the App bar.

Selecting on the photo icon in the menu will take you to the SharePoint folder where your photos are stored.

### Raise hand to speak to hosts and all participants

If a host has enabled **Hand Raise**, you should see the hand raise button in the Menu bar.

Simply select the Hand Raise button, wait for the host to call on you, then you can comment or ask questions to the whole event.

Lower your hand to finish answering your question and speaking to the whole event. You may need to select End broadcast in a multi-room event, as shown below:

### React with emotes

In the app bar, you can trigger **Reactions**, that cause your avatar to
react with body gestures as well as emotes.

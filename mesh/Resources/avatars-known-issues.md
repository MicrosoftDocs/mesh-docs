* Avatar lip sync is not working in the meeting's pre-join screen. If you have your avatar enabled in the pre-join screen and you are unmuted and speak, the avatars mouth will not move. Avatar lip sync will work as expected once you join the meeting.

* When a user with a Teams 2.1 ARM device tries to enable Avatars in Teams, the app may crash. Why? The Onnx runtime that is used for Avatars is not included in Teams 2.1.

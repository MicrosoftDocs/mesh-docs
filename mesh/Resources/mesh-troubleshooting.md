## Frequently asked questions

### What if I limit user permissions with corporate policies

If you do not *allow* users with Teams and Office licenses to create Groups, Sharepoint/OneDrive sites, or use Mailbox/Calendar, the user may notice the following:

1. You cannot create a Collection (formerly called a "Mesh World") since you do not have the ability to do M365 Group creation in your organization.

1. You cannot create an event since you do not have access to M365 Calendar in your organization.

1. One or more people cannot be invited to the event because they do not have access to Outlook.

1. User cannot be added to collection membership since they do not have the ability to access M365 Groups in your organization.

1. You cannot create a template since you do not have access to SharePoint in your organization.

### Will there be support added in future to use an existing M365 Group?

We currently have no plans to support this feature. Right now, when Mesh creates an M365 Group, some additional data is added to the group to identify it as being a Mesh Collection.

### When an M365 Group is created through Mesh, can it still be enabled for Teams after? Just like any other M365 Group?

All M365 Groups created are normal M365 groups. A unique identifier is added to the group for the Mesh Portal to identify which Groups are associated with specific Mesh Collection groups.

### Can we script or automate the creation of an M365 Group for use with Mesh?

We currently do not support this feature.  

### What are the data handling standards for Mesh?

Mesh is a part of M365, and it operates within the [M365 compliance framework](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview), including with respect to security and privacy commitments.

### How to download Mesh on Quest 2 via App Lab

Microsoft Mesh for Meta Quest devices is available through AppLab.

If you had previously downloaded the **Napili** app on your Quest 2 device, you should move to the new app available at the link below.

**Napili** will be deprecated in lieu of the new Microsoft **Mesh (Preview) app**.

1. On your PC, visit the link below to download Mesh on Quest 2.

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Microsoft Mesh on Oculus Quest 2 \| Oculus](https://www.meta.com/experiences/6750166401689690/)

    If the URL doesn't work, use a new private window in your browser.

2. Sign in with your **Meta device account** (*not* your corporate AAD account). This could be your Meta ID, Facebook account, or another
    email.

    [Can't find your Meta account associated with your Quest 2 device?](#how-do-i-find-my-meta-id)

    ![Log in to meta account](media/log-in-meta.png)

3. Once authenticated, select the **Get** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Meta Mesh page on Meta](media/mesh-meta-quest-get.png)

4. You'll see the button grey out and change from **Get** to **Purchased** which indicates that the app has been acquired.

    ![Log in with your Meta account confirmation page](media/mesh-meta-purchased.png)

    >[!Note]
    >You may need to restart your headset to ensure the app loads.

### How do I find my Meta ID?

Log in to Oculus in a web browser, go to **Profile**, and get your email.

1. Go to the Oculus login page on your web browser: [Log in with Facebook \| Meta](https://auth.oculus.com/login/)

2. Continue with your Facebook account or log in with your Oculus account.

3. It should bring you to your **Profile** page. If not, click your **Profile** icon in the top right corner.

   ![A screenshot of profile icon](media/meta-profile.png)

4. Select **Profile**. From there you should see your Email.

#### How to open Mesh on Quest 2

1. Start up your Quest. Use the Oculus button to open the dashboard menu.

1. Select the **App library** button.

    ![the App library button on your Quest menu](media/meta-menu.png)

1. Find the **Microsoft Mesh (Preview)** app in the App library.

1. Select to **Install** then **Open** the app by selecting it again.

1. Complete the device login flow using the link below on your computer (*this requires a mobile phone for verification*): https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/deviceauth

    >[!Note]
    >If the code doesn't work, quit the Microsoft Mesh app and restart it.

    You'll see a window like this when the authentication is complete:

    ![A screenshot of the Mesh startup page as you verify the Quest device on your Microsoft webpage](media/mesh-startup-page.png)

1. Select to **Allow** any **Terms of service & Allow Diagnostic data**.

1. Accept the **Terms of service & Allow Diagnostic data**.

### What should I do if the Mesh app on Windows crashes during startup, crashes during runtime, or behaves strangely during runtime?

1. Confirm you have a license required to use Mesh as shown [here](../setup/content/preparing-your-organization.md#verify-your-licenses-and-policies).

1. Double check that the machine has the latest Operating System and security updates.

1. Double check that your network admins have allowlisted the required endpoints as described [here](../setup/content/preparing-your-organization.md#work-with-your-organizations-security-team).

1. Gather the logs from your device: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\Microsoft Mesh\Player.log`.

1. If the logs are too large to share, the two most important are `Player.log` and `Player-prev.log`.

1. Open a support request by following the link [here](https://admin.microsoft.com) (this support link may only be available to M365 admins).

### Why am I getting an error when accessing Mesh on Quest?

Mesh on Quest currently doesn't support [Azure Active Directory Conditional Access](/appcenter/general/configuring-aad-conditional-access). If your organization applies Conditional Access policies for managed or unmanaged devices, then you won’t be able to access Mesh on Quest. If a user in your organization attempts to launch Mesh on Quest where conditional access policies are applied, they will receive errors [AADSTS50199](/entra/identity-platform/reference-error-codes) and [AADSTS53003](/entra/identity-platform/reference-error-codes).

If you would like to test Mesh on Quest, we recommend **either** deploying Mesh on a test tenant with test accounts where conditional access policies are not applied **or** work with your security IT Administration team to see if they are willing to make a policy exception for select Quest devices. Mesh expects to support conditional access in the future.

### How can I manage Quest VR headsets for my organization?

[Meta Quest for Business](https://forwork.meta.com/quest/business-subscription/) offers user, device, and app management for Meta Quest devices used in the workplace. Quest for Business works with Microsoft Intune to enable you to have a cloud-based unified endpoint management across the broad set of device form factors in your organization.

### How to get a list of signed-in users to Mesh?

Admins may desire a list of users that have signed in to Mesh. You can use the Microsoft Azure portal get a list of users that have signed-in to Mesh due to the fact that all users sign into Mesh with their Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory).

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Microsoft Azure administrator account with an active Microsoft Entra ID.

Follow these steps to get a list of signed-in users to Mesh from the Azure portal:

### Why don't avatars have legs?

Avatars add a new layer of choice to your meetings, both in 2D and 3D immersive spaces. We are continuously researching and collecting feedback on ways to best represent yourself in Mesh and Teams whether it's improving your likeness, adding options for clothing, creating more realistic avatars, or including full body representation. Driving improvements in each of these areas comes with its own set of challenges. In particular, representing legs today is a surprisingly complex engineering challenge - inferring leg position without any data that helps describe actual leg position.

Our goal is to use the latest technologies to their fullest to represent users' likenesses in Mesh and Teams and we will continue to drive toward that goal. Please continue to share your feedback with us so we can evolve how people can visually represent themselves in meetings.

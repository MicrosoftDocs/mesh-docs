# Features in development for Microsoft Mesh

In this article, you can find details about upcoming features, spanning all Mesh experiences, including Immersive experiences in Mesh, Immersive experiences in Teams, Avatars, and Mesh on the web.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features in development roll out through a sphere framework, allowing organizations who have opted in to the [Mesh Technology Adoption Program (Mesh TAP)](../develop/mesh-tap-participants.md) to test and provide feedback on features before they reach general availability.
>
> As these features roll out, some customers may see features before other customers.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Mesh capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## October 2024

Theses are features that we are rolling out as of October 2024.

### Guest access

We are rolling out guest access for Mesh in the Mesh application for PC and Mac! Event organizers will soon be able to invite guest users outside their organization, providing an opportunity for broader collaboration and networking in Mesh events. Guests can sign in to the Mesh app to join events, participate in discussions, and experience the same interactive features as internal users, all while maintaining secure access control.

**Guests** - people who are logged in from outside your organization who access shared resources by signing in using a guest account in your directory. Guests appear with "(Guest)" appended to their name in meetings. A guest user is invited as guest to the organizer tenant. They must have a guest account created for them with Microsoft Entra ID, which provides the same compliance and auditing protection as other Microsoft 365 users. Anyone with a business or consumer email account, such as Outlook, Gmail, or others, can participate as a guest in Mesh events.

A few important notes to consider are:

* Guest users' creation [follows the existing process for tenant guest user creation using Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/external-id/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

* As of now, guest users also require a [Teams Premium license](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams) and [Mesh license](../Setup/Content/it-admin-led-trials.md) similar to all other Mesh event attendees.

* Guest access is not supported on the Mesh app for Quest.

### Event tools for hosts and attendees

* Crowd visualization for hosts and attendees is coming to make it possible to see Mesh event participants in other rooms. The visualization of people in other rooms is proximity based and does not include interaction with people in other rooms at the moment. With the room size limitation, we hope this improvement can breakdown the room barriers and give people a visualization that shows the true scale of Mesh events.

* We are improving the attendee to attendee and host to attendee interactions with avatar selection or click. As an attendee, selecting or clicking on an avatar will raise a menu with the option to open their profile card. As a host, selecting or clicking an attendee avatar will raise a menu with options to megaphone or broadcast (dependent on the room size of the event: single or multi-room) an attendee, mute the attendee, or open their profile card.

## September 2024

Theses are features that we are rolling out as of September 2024.

* In the Microsoft Mesh application, the mouth movement and lip synchronization for avatars will soon more accurately reflect words spoken by users.

* We are rolling out the ability to room hop as a host, empowering hosts to connect with attendees in each room.

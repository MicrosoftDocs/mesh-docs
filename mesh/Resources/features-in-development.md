# Features in development for Microsoft Mesh

In this article, you can find details about upcoming features, spanning all Mesh experiences, including Immersive experiences in Mesh, Immersive experiences in Teams, Avatars, and Mesh on the web.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features in development roll out through a sphere framework, allowing organizations who have opted in to the [Mesh Technology Adoption Program (Mesh TAP)](../develop/mesh-tap-participants.md) to test and provide feedback on features before they reach general availability.
>
> As these features roll out, some customers may see features before other customers.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Mesh capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## September 2024

Theses are features that we are rolling out as of September 2024.

* In the Microsoft Mesh application, the mouth movement and lip synchronization for avatars will soon more accurately reflect words spoken by users.

* Crowd visualization for hosts and attendees is coming to make it possible to see Mesh event participants in other rooms. The visualization of people in other rooms is proximity based and does not include interaction with people in other rooms at the moment. With the room size limitation, we hope this improvement can breakdown the room barriers and give people a visualization that shows the true scale of Mesh events.

* We are improving the attendee to attendee and host to attendee interactions with avatar selecting/clicking. As an attendee, selecting/clicking an avatar will raise a menu with the option to open their profile card. As a host, selecting/clicking an attendee avatar will raise a menu with options to megaphone/broadcast (dependent on the room size of the event: single or multi-room) an attendee, mute the attendee, or open their profile card.

* We are rolling out the ability to room hop as a host, empowering hosts to connect with attendees in each room.

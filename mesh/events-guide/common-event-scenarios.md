# Common scenarios for event hosts

There are a host of scenarios that Mesh can be used for, including Q&A (Question and Answer), screen sharing with a large audience, and much more.

In this article, we'll cover how to run a Q&A session; involve the audience and make attendees audible to all participants even if they aren't a host.

## Event Producers tools

- **Organizer tools**: Mute all, enable/disable Handraise, Megaphone, Screenshare, and Broadcast (for Multi-room events) are all located in the left Organizer tools button in the Menu bar.

    **Single room events**

## Using hand raise for Q&A

As a host, you may want participants to be able to ask their questions or say comments to the whole event.

### Enable Hand Raise for all participants

To allow participants to raise their hand, you must **enable Hand Raise** using the **Organizer tools**.

1. Open the **Organizer tools**.

1. Select the Hand Raise button in the Organizer tools to enable it.

### Call on people in single room events

In single room events, as a host you'll see who has their hand raised in the People panel and in the event. Use the Megaphone button next to their name to enable **Megaphone** for attendees so all participants can hear them.

### Call on people in multi-room events

In multi-room scenarios, attendees will only be able to talk to other people in their room. As a host, you will not see or hear attendees unless they raise their hand or you call on them. If attendees use emojis, however, you will you able to see their emojis and location across rooms!

To call on attendees, look in the People panel and select the **Broadcast** button, as shown below.

Once you select broadcast, they will receive a notification request for them to be broadcast. Once they accept, they will then be broadcast to the whole event and all participants.

#### Visual indicators for attendee megaphone or broadcast

When an attendee is megaphoned or broadcast, there are a few visual indicators and notifications that you will see. In the People panel, anybody who is broadcasting will have their profile highlighted and the Megaphone or broadcast logo will show next to their name.

# Produce your event

## Considerations before starting your event

### Customize **before** your event

To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize and save customizations at least 30 minutes before the event start time.

### Event capacity

- 200 attendees per event
- 16 attendees per room
- Up to 16 hosts in a separate room, additional to the 200 attendees

## Event Producers tools

- **[Organizer tools](#organizer-tools)**: Mute all, enable/disable Handraise, Megaphone, Screenshare, and Broadcast (for Multi-room events) are all located in the left Organizer tools button in the Menu bar.

    **Single room events**

    **Multi-room events**

    :::image type="content" source="../Resources/media/Organizer-tools-people-panel-multi-room-2412.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Organizer tools and People panel in the Mesh app.":::

- **[People panel](#people-panel)**: The people in your event can now be found in the People panel. In this panel, you can see who has raised their hand and megaphone or broadcast (in multi-room events) them.

    **Single room events**

    :::image type="content" source="../Resources/media/People-panel-single-room-2412.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Mesh app showing the people panel in a single room event.":::

    **Multi-room events**
    For Multi-room events, you'll be able to switch between the People tab and the Additional rooms tab

    :::image type="content" source="../Resources/media/People-panel-multi-room-2412.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing the people panel expanded in a multi-room event.":::

- **[Control panel](#control-panel):** Control the elements that were added in a Customization session. [Play a video](#control-objects-in-the-control-panel), for example, or control custom objects that you may have added!

## Common event scenarios

For those interested in running question and answer scenarios where participants can raise their hand, be called on by the host, and megaphoned or broadcast to the entire event, see the [common event scenarios article](common-event-scenarios.md) for more info.

## Join the event

After you've created your event, customized it, and added content to the control panel, it's time to join and produce your event.

> [!TIP]
> **Ensure that you've [customized your event](customize-event.md) properly** (added custom content or objects to your environment, added it to the control panel, and saved) before producing your event.

1. Open the Mesh app directly or use the link your calendar invite to open the Mesh app.

1. Find your event in the **Upcoming** or **Happening now** sections, and select **Join**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Join-event-2314-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing join button highlighted.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    >
> As a host, you'll join into a Host Room along with any other co-organizers. Attendees will be in their own room(s).

1. Adjust your device settings to ensure they're set up properly.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Device-settings-setup-before-join.png" alt-text="Device settings adjustment  inside pre-join window for Mesh event.":::

Once you select **Join now**, you'll utilize two main tools, Host panel and the Control panel, for your run of show:

### Organizer tools

#### Mute all

Mute all attendees in the event. Hosts in the event can still use their mics and mute or unmute.

**Enabled:** Attendees are muted and cannot mute or unmute.

**Disabled:** Attendees can now use their microphone.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/producer-tools-mute-all-2314.png" alt-text="Mute all button highlighted in host panel":::

#### Hand Raise

Enable or disable Hand Raise for participants. Hand Raise is ideal for Question and Answer scenarios. When an attendee raises their hand, there will be an indicator next to their name in the host panel and a hand raise emoji their avatar or profile bubble.

**Hand raise enabled:** Participants can raise their hand to await being called on and megaphoned.

**Hand raise disabled:** Participants cannot raise their hand.

:::image type="content" source="../media/common-event-scenarios\producer-tools-hand-raise-2314.png" alt-text="Hand raise button highlighted in host panel.":::

When an attendee has their hand raised, you'll see the hand raise notification next to their name in the host panel and see a hand raise icon above their profile bubble.

:::image type="content" source="../Resources/media/Emoji-reactions-hand-raise-multi-room.png" alt-text="Screenshot of hand raise icon above another avatars name in a multi-room event.":::

In a single room event, you'll also see hand raise icon above their avatar.

:::image type="content" source="../media/common-event-scenarios/Event-host-Hand-raise-notifications.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing hand raise notification next to participant names and avatar.":::

> [!TIP]
> In multi-room events, you won't see any attendee avatars until they are broadcast.

Learn how to [use Hand Raise for question and answer (Q&A) scenarios](common-event-scenarios.md#using-hand-raise-for-qa)

#### Megaphone

Amplify your voice to all participants in the event. A great tool when broadcasting or using a screenshare.

**Megaphone and Broadcast enabled:** Host voice is amplified to all participants in all rooms.

**Megaphone enabled:** Host voice is amplified to all participants in the Host's room only.

**Disabled:** Host voice is not amplified.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/producer-tools-megaphone-2314.png" alt-text="Megaphone button in host panel":::

#### Broadcast

In multi-room events, use broadcast anytime you wish to be seen or heard by your whole audience in all rooms. Broadcasted avatars are visually distinguished by a purple-rings effect applied to their avatar.

**Enabled:** Host avatar and voice are broadcast to all rooms in the event.

**Disabled:** Host avatar and voice are not broadcasted to all rooms.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/producer-tools-broadcast-2314-multi-room.png" alt-text="Broadcast button in a Mesh event in the host panel.":::

#### Broadcast or Megaphone other participants

In a multi-room scenario, you'll use Broadcast to make the participant visible to all other participants. This is ideal when someone has raised their hand, as shown below:

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/producer-tools-hand-raise-2314-multi-room.png" alt-text="Hand raise and broadcast  in a multi-room Mesh event in the host panel.":::

> [!NOTE]
> A maximum of five people can broadcast at the same time, including host avatars and attendee avatars.

When you request an attendee to broadcast or megaphone, you'll receive a notification. Once you request it, the attendee will also receive the request and be able to accept or deny the option.

:::image type="content" source="../media/common-event-scenarios/Request-to-broadcast-or-megaphone.png" alt-text="Screenshot of request to megaphone or broadcast from the host perspective.":::

#### Share

Share your screen or a specific window on your PC to all participants. Screenshare requires the Screenshare object that is [added when you customize your Event or Template](customize-event.md#add-content-with-editor).

**Enabled:** Host screen or window will be shown to all participants.

**Disabled:** Host screen or window is not shown.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/producer-tools-sharing-2314.png" alt-text="Share button in host panel":::

> [!NOTE]
> As with Microsoft Teams, an organizer will not see their active screen share. However, all non-sharing attendees will be able to see the screen share.

**How to screenshare:**

1. Select the **Screenshare** button in the menu bar at the top.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-screenshare-button-pushed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app, host panel open, screenshare selected.":::

1. Select the monitor screen or window that you want to share.

1. You will have two notifications visible to indicate that you are screensharing.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Screenshare-alerts-shown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing alerts for screenshare.":::

1. Exit or stop sharing your screen by selecting the Share button again at the top of host panel.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/producer-tools-sharing-stop-2314.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing stop sharing button in host panel.":::

### People panel

The people panel allows you to see who is in event, including those that have their hands raised and who is in each room.

:::image type="content" source="../Resources/media/People-panel-single-room-2412.png" alt-text="Screenshot of people panel in a single room in the Mesh app.":::

At the top of the panel, you have *two tabs* to choose from:

- **Participants:** See participants in your room, which can be sorted by *All*, *Hand raised*, or *Broadcasting*.
- **Rooms:** See a list of all of the rooms in your multiroom event, including the Host Room. For each room, there's a attendee count to see how many people are in each room.

## Control panel

The Control panel is used to control the content or objects that were added when customizing an Event or Template. To learn more, see how to [Customize your event](customize-event.md).

### Control objects in the Control panel

1. Select the **Control panel** button in the bottom right of the menu bar.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-control-panel-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing Control panel button and panel":::

In the Control panel, you'll see all the objects and content that you added to your Event or Template.

1. In the Control panel, select an object and interact with its controls as desired during your event.

    In the example below, in the **Play state** section for the **Video** object, we can select the **Play** button to play the video.

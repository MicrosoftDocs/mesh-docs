# Customize your event

## Considerations before starting your event

### Customize before your event

* To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize and save customizations at least **30 minutes before** the event start time. Once someone joins the event, saving customizations is not available.

> [!TIP]
> **Who should customize an event?**
>
> Anyone who has been invited as a **Co-organizer** can customize an event. Do this with
> caution, knowing that any edits you make will directly alter the Event or Template
> that event attendees will join.

## Why customize an event?

As a host for a Mesh event, you have many tools at your disposal to orchestrate an experience for attendees.

Along with tools to interact with and manage guests, you have a Control Panel to manage aspects of the environment. You may want to play a video when people enter the event, use text to draw attention to objects or give directions to attendees, or execute a pre-planned sequence of actions like a stage director raising the curtain and queueing the lights. All of this can be added (and more) when you customize your event.

### Types of customizations

* Add objects through the Editor like Screenshares, Images, or Videos.

    * 

* Use the **Control Panel** to adjust Objects that you have in your environment using the **Controls** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Control-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of control panel showing the objects in an environment.":::

* Use the **Control Panel** > **Action Groups** tab to control multiple objects at once for an experience such as displaying photos of your team, or showing a company logo and playing a video.

## How to customize an event

## Customization flow

1. Once your event is created using [https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/](https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/), open the Mesh app to find and start customizing your event.

1. **Add content** using the **Editor**.

1. **Configure** content with the **Control panel** to be used in your live event. You can edit the Controls of each object individually or group them together in Action Groups.

## How to enter the Customization session

## Start customizing

Now that you've created an event and joined the Event customization experience, it's time customize it in the [Microsoft Mesh app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-mesh/9NLXZJ1FDBD7) and add any run-of-show tools you'd like to use.

At a high level, there are three major steps to customize your event or template:

1. **Add content** using the **Environment Editor** (or playable content uploaded from Unity to a custom environment).

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Customize-select-editor-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Editor button highlighted in Mesh app.":::

1. Select the object to edit its properties.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Customize-event-control-panel-object-selection.png" alt-text="Image object adjustment":::

1. Use the **Control Panel** to adjust your objects or create **Action Groups** to control multiple objects simultaneously.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Action-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the control panel in Mesh experience with Action Groups tab selected. Several actions are highlighted such as display images.":::

1. **Save changes** in the **Save** window. Or select **Revert** to discard recent changes and revert to the last saved state.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Customize-event-object-save-changes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing save changes dialogue after customizing.":::

## Add content with Editor

Use the Editor to place content in your environment and customize the content displayed in each object.

:::image type="content" source="../Resources/media/environment-editor-catalog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of editor catalog":::

The three objects we'll cover here are **Video**, **Image**, and **Screenshare**.

Use the Editor to add content to your environment that can be controlled during your run-of-show.

1. Once it loads, Select the **Editor** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-customization-editor-open.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing Editor open with no objects added.":::

1. Select the **+** plus button to open the **Catalog** of objects that you can add. Select one to add it to the environment editor.

1. Once you've added an object, you'll see it show up in the Objects window as shown below:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image-environment-editor-added-artifact.png" alt-text="Video player object shown in list of objects":::

    Note the **Edit**, **Duplicate**, and **Delete** buttons for the selected object.

1. Now you can manipulate the object as you'd like by selecting it with your cursor, dragging it to another location, or using the edges of the objects to scale them as you see fit.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/environment-editor-maneuver-artifact2.png" alt-text="Move object with avatar arm up":::

    To position your object - with the environment editor open:

    1. Select and drag your object to move it left, right, up, or down.
    1. **Alt + Select** and drag up or down to move the object toward and away from you.
    1. **Shift + Select** and drag up or down to make the object bigger or smaller.
    1. You can also use the rotation and scale handles on the object to rotate and scale your object. Just select the handle and drag to rotate or scale.

    Make sure you check out the position from different angles to verify you’ve placed it properly.

    >[!Tip]
    >while you are moving an object you’ll see a small line drawn from your object down to the floor. This can help you position your objects relative to landmarks in the scene such as the edge of a stage or a piece of furniture.

### Video object requirements

For video objects, you must:

- Use **.MP4** file type only.
- Use direct links to video files that are stored on SharePoint or HTTPS URLs. Links to video services like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. are not supported

    For example, use the **Share** or the **Copy Link** functionality in SharePoint to copy the link of the video you want to share and paste it in the Video player object URL field.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/SharePoint-link.png" alt-text="Sharepoint link copied in sharepoint":::

### Edit object controls

Once you've added an object, you can maneuver it around the spaces and select the it to edit the controls.

1. Select an added object and adjust the controls to suit your preferences.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image-environment-editor-open-controls-window.png" alt-text="Controls window showing for object that has been added to an environment":::

1. Configure the controls for the object. For example, you can add the URL for your video:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Configure-controls-artifact-larger.gif" alt-text="Add objects and update url":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The only video type that is supported is **.MP4**.

## Prepare content with the Control panel

The **Control panel** shows all the controls available for your content during the event. Like having a technical booth for theatrical technicians, it's designed to give the organizer the ability to orchestrate a performance in real time.

You can try out the controls during the customization session, but make sure you set everything back to how you want your event to look when it starts and then save your changes (or if you're just practicing, you can use **Revert changes** in the save dialog).

**Control panel Notes:**

- Playable content can be added from the environment editor or from a Unity project that has been uploaded to a custom environment. Reference the [Choose your journey article](../develop/getting-started/choose-your-journey.md)
    to get started with adding custom content.

## Save your content

Before you start your event, you must save the changes that you've made to your environment.

Select the **Save button** or **Revert changes.**

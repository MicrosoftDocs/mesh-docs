# Adding objects to your event or template

Now that you've created an event or template and joined the Event customization experience, it's time customize it in the [Microsoft Mesh app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-mesh/9NLXZJ1FDBD7) and add any run-of-show tools you'd like to use.

At a high level, there are three major steps to customize your event or template:

1. **Add content** using the **Environment Editor** (or playable content uploaded from Unity to a custom environment).

    The three objects that you can add to through the editor are **Video**, **Screenshare**, and **Image**.

    |Object |Controls  |Notes  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Video   |   URL, Looping, Volume, Backplate, Visible      |  Direct links to videos hosted via SharePoint or HTTPS URLs and **.MP4** file types only.       |
    |Screenshare     |  Visible       |  Display screen as an event host with Organizer or Co-Organizer privileges.       |
    |Image     |  URL, Orientation, Backplate, Visible      |   Direct links to images hosted via SharePoint or HTTPS URLs      |

1. Select the object to edit its properties.

1. Use the **Control Panel** to adjust your objects or create **Action Groups** to control multiple objects simultaneously.

1. **Save changes** in the **Save** window. Or select **Revert** to discard recent changes and revert to the last saved state.

### Add content with Editor

Use the Editor to place content in your environment and customize the content displayed in each object.

Use the Editor to add content to your environment that can be controlled during your run-of-show.

1. Select the **Editor** button.

1. Select the **+** plus button to open the **Catalog** of objects that you can add. Select one to add it to the environment editor.

1. Once you've added an object, you'll see it show up in the Objects window as shown below:

    Note the **Edit**, **Duplicate**, and **Delete** buttons for the selected object.

    > [!TIP]
    >  Playable content can be added from the environment editor or from a Unity project that has been uploaded to a custom environment. Reference the [Choose your journey article](../../develop/getting-started/choose-your-journey.md)
    >     to get started with adding custom content.

1. Now you can manipulate the object as you'd like by selecting it with your cursor, dragging it to another location, or using the edges of the objects to scale them as you see fit.

    To position your object - with the environment editor open:

    1. Select and drag your object to move it left, right, up, or down.
    1. **Alt + Select** and drag up or down to move the object toward and away from you.
    1. **Shift + Select** and drag up or down to make the object bigger or smaller.
    1. You can also use the rotation and scale handles on the object to rotate and scale your object. Just select the handle and drag to rotate or scale.

    Make sure you check out the position from different angles to verify you’ve placed it properly.

    >[!Tip]
    >while you are moving an object you’ll see a small line drawn from your object down to the floor. This can help you position your objects relative to landmarks in the scene such as the edge of a stage or a piece of furniture.

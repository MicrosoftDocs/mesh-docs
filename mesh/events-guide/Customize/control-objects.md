# Control your content with the Control Panel

The **Control panel** holds all the controls available for your content during the event. Like having a technical booth for theatrical technicians, it's designed to give the organizer the ability to orchestrate a performance in real time.

You can try out the controls during the customization session, but make sure you set everything back to how you want your event to look when it starts and then save your changes (or if you're just practicing, you can use **Revert changes** in the save dialog).

#### Create an Action Group

Sometimes you want to trigger multiple production elements simultaneously, like starting a video and revealing a banner image at the same time. To simplify multiple actions into just one click in the Control Panel, you can create an Action Group.

Action Groups allow organizers to take a bunch of content, preconfigure the controls for it, and save everything to a single-click group in the Control Panel.

For example, you might want to create an Action Group that contains all of the things you’d like to trigger for the Welcome portion of your event. Here, you might want to hide a countdown video, toggle the screenshare object to visible, and unfurl some logos. If you add each element individually to the Control Panel, you will have to take multiple actions to trigger these changes. Or you can simplify it all down to one-click with an Action Group.

To create an **Action Group**, start by opening your **Control Panel** and selecting the “Action Groups” tab:

1. Select the **+** button then type in your name for the Action Group.
1. In the Action group panel, select the **Pencil icon** then choose the objects you want to add to the group and **Confirm**.

1. For each object, choose the **Pencil icon** to choose which properties you want to control then select the controls you want to be included in the Action Group.

1. Adjust the controls for each object and select the **Save** icon. You'll see the Action Group show up in the **Control Panel** to the right.

1. Repeat for all Action Groups you want, then you'll have a sequence of Actions available for use in your event.

## Save your content

Before you start your event, you must save the changes that you've made to your environment.

Select the **Save button** or **Revert changes.**

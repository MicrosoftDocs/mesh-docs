# Create an event in the Mesh portal

This is a test update for a video.

Use the Mesh portal to create and manage events, Mesh worlds, and custom environments. Once events are made, Mesh events show up in your Outlook or Teams calendar with a direct link that people can use to join events, making inviting and joining events quicker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure that all participants have updated their Mesh app to the most recent version to ensure that they can use the link in their calendar invite and join the event you just created!

## Create an event

1. Open the [Mesh Portal](https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/).

1. Log in with your corporate account.

1. In the Home page, select **Events** in the left nav.

1. Add the event name, time duration, description, upload a thumbnail image, and adjust the room capacity settings.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Events should not be longer than 3 hours and scheduled more than 30 minutes in advance.

    > Once your event is created, you cannot change the environment, the template, or room configuration, room capacity, or Max Participants.

    Learn more about [creating event templates](create-template.md).

1. Add your Co-organizers (who will be able to edit the event) and your Attendees (who will be able to join the event) and select **Create event** when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/m365-migration-guide/Invite-attendees-co-organizers.png" alt-text="Invite page in the Mesh portal":::

Great job! You've now created your event. Co-organizers and invitees will now see the event in their Outlook and Teams calendars.

Co-organizers can also invite people in outlook and forward the invite to people as desired.

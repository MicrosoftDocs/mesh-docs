# Create an event in Mesh on the web

Use Mesh on the web to create and manage events, Mesh collections, and custom environments. Once events are made, Mesh events show up in your Outlook or Teams calendar with a direct link that people can use to join events, making inviting and joining events quicker.

The overall flow of creating an event in Mesh on the web is:

1. Go to [https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/](https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/).
1. Select **Create event** in the top right.
1. Add the **Title**, **Date/Duration**, and **Details about the event**.
1. Choose your room settings like:
    1. **Single room** (up to 16 people, 24-hour time limit)
    1. **Multi-room** (up to 200 people, hosts are grouped in one room, 3-hour time limit)
1. Invite people:
    1. **Co-organizers** (People to help set up and run the event)
    1. **Attendees** (People to join the event)
1. Choose the event space:
    1. **Choose a template** (that you or someone previously created)
    1. **Start from scratch** (a default environment or custom environment with no customizations)
1. (Optional) Upload a event cover image (size 512x256 px)
1. (Optional) Customize your event 30 minutes before it starts!

## Considerations before your event

- **Single room events (16 people max)**: 24-hour time limit.
- **Multi-room events (200 people max)**: 3-hour time limit.
  - Hosts are grouped into a separate room (up-to 16 hosts + 200 attendees)
- **Customize and save edits at least 30 minutes** before your event to ensure the event runs smoothly.

## Create an event

1. Open Mesh on the web at [https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/](https://mesh.cloud.microsoft/).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Mesh on the web is moving to cloud.microsoft [with all Microsoft 365 apps and services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-cloud-microsoft-a-unified-domain-for-microsoft-365/ba-p/3804961). To use the new cloud.microsoft endpoint, ensure you have allowed the proper endpoints allowed, as detailed in the [Preparing your organization article](../Setup/Content/preparing-your-organization.md#endoints-and-firewall-ports-for-immersive-spaces-in-mesh-mesh-app).
    >
    > If you have any issues with the new Mesh on the web experience, you can continue to use *portal.mesh.microsoft.com*.

1. Log in with your corporate account.

1. Select **Create event** at the top right.

1. Add the **Title**, **Date/Duration**, and **Details about the event**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > All events should be scheduled more than 30 minutes in advance to allow for event customization in the Mesh app.

1. Choose the room configuration for your event: **Single** or **Multi-room**.

1. Add your **Co-organizers** and your **Attendees**. You may add groups or individuals.
    1. **Co-organizers** can edit the event, customize the environment in the Mesh application, and forward the event or invite others in Outlook
    1. **Attendees** can join the event.

1. Choose the event space: **Choose a template** or **Start from scratch**.

    > [!TIP]
    > With Mesh, you can create environment templates with customizations to be reused as needed. [Create a Template](create-template.md), customize it once, and reuse it again and again.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/events-guide-create-event/4-choose-event-space.png" alt-text="Screenshot of event space options: template or start from scratch in Mesh on the web.":::

    1. Whether you **Choose a template** or **Start from scratch**, you can choose environments from Microsoft directly or from your Collections.

1. (Optional) Upload an event cover image.

Great job! You've now created your event. Co-organizers and invitees will now see the event in their Outlook and Teams calendars. Select **Customize now** to open the Mesh app and [customize your event](customize-event.md) by adding objects to your environment to help with your meeting.
